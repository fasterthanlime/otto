# otto

You made some wrong choices in your life and you made a thing that depends on something terrible,
like GTK3. What you didn't realize, or maybe forgot, is that it depends on a gazillion libraries.

What's more, you're a good pal, so you want 32-bit support as well. Now you have to compile a bunch
of libraries by hand or wrestle with distribution package managers forever.

Or... you could use otto. See sample config in `samples/`

### Disclaimer

If you use otto and it works, don't tell anyone - use your newfound powers to increase your
earnings and get the drop on your enemies.

If you use otto and it doesn't work, you'll get your money back - 0 (zero) cents, but not your time.
